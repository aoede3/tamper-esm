## Tamper

Tamper is a serialization protocol for categorical data. It allows you to quickly and efficently transfer bulk datasets from server to browser.

Encoders are available in the encoders folder:

- Ruby
- Go
- JavaScript

Currently, the deserializer is only implemented in JavaScript in folder clients/js/src/tamper.js.
